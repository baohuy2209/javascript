    <h1 class = "h1" >Overriding the Express </h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            The Express API consists of various methods and properties on the request and response objects. 
            These are inherited by prototype. There are two extension points for the Express API 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The global prototypes at express.request and express.response . 
            </li>
            <li>
                App-specific prototypes at app.request and app.reponse .
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Altering the global protoypes will affest all loaded Express apps in the same process. If desires, alterations can 
            be made app-specific by only altering the app-specific prototypes after creating a new app. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class = "h2">Methods</h2>

        <p>
            You can override the signature and behavior of existing methods with your own, by assigning a custiom function. 
            Following is an example of overriding the behavior of <a href = "http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html">res.sendStatus</a> . 
        </p>

        <pre class = "language - javascript">
            <code class = "language - javascript">
                <code>app.response.sendStatus = <code class = "res_sendStatus_line-1">function </code>(statusCode, type, message) {</code>
                <code class = "res_sendStatus_line-2">code is intentionally kept simple for demonstration purpose</code>
                <code>      return this.contentType(type).status(statusCode).send(message)</code>
                <code>}</code>
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>The above implementation completely changes the orginal signature of res.sendStatus. It now accepts a status code, encoding type, and the message to be sent to the client.</p>
        <p>The overridden method may now be used this way </p>
        <code>res.sendStatus(404, 'applicationapplication/json', '{"error":"resource not found"}')</code>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class = "h2">Properties</h2>

        <p>Properties in the Express API are either </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Assigned properties (req.baseUrl, req.originalUrl)</li>
            <li>Defines as getters (req.secure, req.ip)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Since properties under category 1 are dynamically assinged on the request and response objects in the context of the current request-response cycle, 
            their behaviors cannot be overriden. 
        </p>
        <p>Properties under category 2 can be overwritten using the Express API extensions API</p>
